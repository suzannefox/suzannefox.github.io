      <p>We often take our Sun for granted – it is our constant companion, day in and day out, and we literally
        would not
        be able to live without it.
        At a diameter of nearly 1.4 million kilometres, the Sun is massive compared to the Earth – over 100
        times larger
        in diameter.
        It contains over 99% of the mass of all of the other objects in our solar system. Our Sun is just an
        average-sized star.
        Some stars are hundreds of times the diameter of our Sun, and many are only a tenth the size of our Sun.

      <p>At its core lies the engine that generates the light we see and the heat we feel. The temperatures here
        reach 15 million
        degrees. At these high temperatures and under the massive pressures at the core, hydrogen nuclei can
        fuse together to
        create helium. However, a helium nucleus is slightly lighter than the original hydrogen nuclei, and so a
        by-product of
        this fusion is that the Sun converts this tiny little bit of extra mass into energy – heat and light –
        obeying
        Einstein’s famous formula, E=mc². There are so many fusion reactions taking place every second however,
        that this
        amounts to a total of about 4 million tonnes of mass converted to energy every second – that’s a lot of
        energy released
        every second! This amount of the mass of the Sun that is ‘lost’ every second may seem alarming, but we
        need not panic –
        the Sun contains lots of hydrogen fuel and will be with us for at least another 4 billion years.</p>
